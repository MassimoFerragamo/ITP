#Documentation for Fizz Buzz 

####this was my first code
This is what I wrote
let counter = 0 
while (counter <= 100); {
  counter =+ 1
  if (counter % 3 === 0); {
    if (counter % 5 ===0); {
      console.log("fizz buzz");}
    else; {
      console.log("fizz"); }}
  else if (counter % 5 === 0);{
    console.log("buzz")}
  else;{ 
    console.log(counter); 
 
####it didn't work

####this is my second code 
let counter = 0 
while (counter < 100){
counter += 1
   if (counter % 3 === 0){
      if (counter % 5 ===0) {
         console.log("fizz buzz");}
      else{ 
         console.log("fizz");}}
    else if (counter % 5 === 0){
    console.log("buzz")}
  else {
    console.log(counter);}}
	
####it did work 

so the only trouble shooting I had to do was break down the code and figure out where the semicolons went 
and also correct my counter.
