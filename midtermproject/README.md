# MIDTERM PROJECT


#######Performance piece: Frozen steve reich


I sampled the amen break and used that to build a kind of little music performance 

I used his piece [vessels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwYFxCnc9fg)

the code itself is just the code from the code along, repurposed so that I could have 6 sounds with different keys and change the rate of my seal sample.
