## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Cool Module

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

A VCV module that I can communicate with using arduino. 

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

If my project will work. I will be able to control cv, using knobs and buttons connected to my arduino board. I will be able to connect my CV processor/generator to other modules in VCV rack. I will code most of it in C++ 11. it will feature a button activated buffer effect to loop and Granulate CV. If it's possible I would also like to add an integrated voltage mixer so i can overdub multiple takes of my CV into the voltage mixer so I can get interesting modulation shapes. I could also use another knob to slow down the rate of my loop.

## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

Yes I plan to work along side some of my circuit bending studies. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Code a basic CV processor for VCV rack. an attenuverter, and looper. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The module is a CV generator, with a looping, overdub mixing and processing. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

the module reads CV from arduino. Gates, Triggers and CV that I can process, and loop it, slow it down, invert it, attenuate it, overdub voltage mixing. Possibly I can also share it with other people. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

My next step would be to know if this is too ambitious and if it's not my first step would be to learn as much as possible about C++11 and read the VCV rack plugin development page.
