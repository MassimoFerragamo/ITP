I wouldn't say that we had too many problems, the only thing that we encountered was, I pushed things on github while Lilith, Hana and Anda were working on their side of the project, so when they would push my code would get deleted and vice versa. 

I also used chat GPT to help me put in a picture as the website background. 



I think I was somewhat useful, I did the background and the hyper link, as well as coming up for some of the ideas for the band concept 

It was a very colaborative project, everyone did their part. Lilith did the most though.
