## Mattina
### Giuseppe Ungaretti 
#### 1917 

`for my Haiku I chose a poem by my favorite italian author called Giuseppe Ungaretti, he was part of a movement called "Ermetismo" (Hermeticism) which focused on very short poems which I thought fitting with the idea of the Haiku. I also thought it would be funny to make my computer say something in italian, I had to change the spelling slighty for it to be intelligible. The poem is called Mattina (morning) and it reads: M'illumino D'immenso (I illuminate (myself) with immensity)`
