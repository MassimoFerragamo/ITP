# Farenheit to Celsius converter 
##### Documentation 


[i wanted to make the converter as interractive as possible and have it be functional, so I looked at the first chapter in the readings a lot as a tool to help me with my code. the first thing I did is to bind farenheit to the result of a number prompt. then if it is a number, it outputs the calculation. otherwise i put a while loop in which until the code receives a number it is going to keep asking to give it a number. when it does receive a number, it outputs the calculation and breaks the loop.]
